# Music-Player-App
Music Player App With tkinter And youtube Api

# I have named it "Melodify"

This is the simple music player app using tkinter and ttkbootstap for the design

Here are some known issuses in this app
1. Listbox won't display recent songs
2. Songs will overlap each other unless you stop one and then play another
3. Progress bar doesnot work at the time

I will fix and commit it soon if anyone wanna fork they are free to.

You can get your youtube api from https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/youtube.googleapis.com/

All the files will be saved in cache directory by deafult if you are unable to download file due to filepath, do consider making cache folder in that folder or fell free to modify code in there.

Here are the screenshot of app itself
